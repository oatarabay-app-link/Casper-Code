not added: 
__________ 

- we should add new design for Getting started  
- refresh the app button

- auto connect is not working when user first install the app - because no vpnprofile created yet, so if user was connected before the code will work becuse a vpn profile will not be empty = null (you can create a vpn profile if it's = null, but it's not mandatory)  
- check how to minimise the code size 
- check if library take a lot of battery and MBs 

Errors / Security: 
__________________

- counter not the same as in the notification bar, sometimes
- battery problem 
- intercom chat block guest users - we should add more security - preferencense or sqllite ! maybe delete it !
- a small bugs (when user enter the app first time) 
- server side problem with subscription (if user account expired and he takes 4 days to open the app after expiry date ended he will he will get 4 days for free) system should update his expiry date = last one + 30 days (so we should send a field from android app recurring = true)
- subscription scenario should be like this:
  when user enter the app, app should send a request to the server 
  this request is just to call the server for checking user's account
  server will check if he's subscribed, if yes it will return the username and subscribed = true and if he's still active
